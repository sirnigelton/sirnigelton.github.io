				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>Greetings! My name is Nigel Dunetts, and this page is just the beginning of my Dev Bootcamp journey. I am from Omaha, NE originally, but I have also lived in Illinois, Missouri, and Minnesota. I currently call Boulder, CO home, and work for an ESP called SendGrid during the day as a tech support agent. In my free time I enjoy disc golf, attending concerts, hiking, biking, camping, and drinking delicious craft beers.</p>
