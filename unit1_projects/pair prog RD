        <h2>Driver</h2>
        <p>The driver's primary role is to type out the code for the project that you're working on.  They interpret what the navigator is trying to explain or accomplish.  They are the fine detail people who are concerned with making sure all of the smaller parts are working together properly.</p>
        <h2>Navigator</h2>
        <p>The primary role of the navigator is to conceptualize the design of the project they are trying to create.  They are the "big picture" person who is concerned with the overall layout and function</p>
