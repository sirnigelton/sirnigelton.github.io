			<p><strong>Choosing the correct disc</strong><br/>There are many different varieties of discs out there, and if you're new to the sport then the number of choices can be overwhelming. For beginners, discs of a ligher weight tend to be easier to control, since they generally fly straight and glide well.<br/>Heavier discs, on the other hand, require a higher degree of control when thrown because the higher weights make them more difficult to throw level, but their weight allows them to acheive greater distances.</p>
			<p><strong>Developing proper technique</strong><br/>The most important aspect of the throw to remember is <em>always follow through on your shots</em>.
