			<p><strong>Choosing the correct disc</strong><br/>There are many different varieties of discs out there, and if you're new to the sport then the number of choices can be overwhelming. For beginners, discs of a ligher weight tend to be easier to control, since they generally fly straight and glide well. Light weight discs are understable, meaning that they flight straight for most of their flight path before breaking left or right.<br/>Heavier discs, on the other hand, require a much higher degree of control when thrown because the higher weights make these discs more difficult to throw level and fly properly. They are prone to being overstable, meaning that they tend to start curving sooner in the flight path, but their weight allows them to acheive greater distances.</p>
