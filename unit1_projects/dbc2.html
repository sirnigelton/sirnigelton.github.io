			<p><strong>Choosing the Correct Disc</strong><br/>There are many different varieties of discs out there, and if you're new to the sport then the number of choices can be overwhelming. For beginners, discs of a ligher weight tend to be easier to control, since they generally fly straight and glide well.<br/>Heavier discs, on the other hand, require a higher degree of control when thrown because the higher weights make them more difficult to throw level, but their weight allows them to acheive greater distances.</p>
			<p><strong>Developing Proper Technique</strong><br/>The most important aspect of the throw to remember is <em>always follow through</em>. Proper follow through starts with turning your hips into your throws, and ends with bringing your throwing arm across your entire body. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgn6Os4YSW0">video</a> on the basics of throwing covers the correct motions in more detail.
				<ul>
					<li>Driving:  How you grip the disc will determine the throwing technique you want to use. For those that prefer the standard backhand drive, check out this <a href="http://www.innovadiscs.com/media/PDF/backhand-drive-chart.pdf">chart</a>.Those more comfortable with the forehand shot should consult this <a href="http://www.innovadiscs.com/media/PDF/forehand-drive-chart.pdf">chart</a>. Footwork is another important aspect of the drive, as proper balance and bent knees will ensure that your drive is consistent every time.</li>
					<li>Midrange Throwing:  A good midrange shot should be aimed short of your target, but you still want to remember the basic guidelines of a good throw. Since you are generally trying to approach the basket with a midrange disc, you want to aim your shots just a bit short of where you'd like them to land. This is because midrange discs tend to be light weight, and thus more likely to glide.</li>
					<li>Putting:  The easiest putting style for beginners is the arc. As the name implies, you want the disc to make a somewhat lofty up and down arc. The key to throwing it with little curve in your flight path lies in your release. Try to use the spring of your fingers, as if you were throwing a dart, to cleanly release the disc in order to avoid a wobbly flight path. Praticing the same putting technique, no matter what you prefer, is paramount in mastering your putt.</li>
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Playing Regularly</strong><br>As with every other physical skill, practice makes perfect. Having a maintained course nearby is immensely convenient, but for those that aren't as geographically fortunate there are other alternatives. You can purchase disc golf baskets online and from some sporting good stores, or you can try <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=make%20your%20own%20disc%20golf%20basket">making your own</a>.</p>
