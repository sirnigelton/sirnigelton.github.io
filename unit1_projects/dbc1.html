		<h3>On vegetables</h3>
				<p>Barney's Dad was really bad so Barney hatched a plan,<br/>When his dad said "Eat your peas,"<br/>Barney shouted, "No!" and ran.</p>
				<p>Barney tricked his mean old dad and locked him in the cellar,<br/>Barney's Mom never found out where he'd gone,<br/>Cause Barney didn't tell her.</p>
				<p>There his dad spent his life eating mice and gruel,<br/>With every bite for fifty years,<br/>He was sorry he'd been cruel.</p>

		<h3>On realistic expectations</h3>
				<p><strong>Calvin:</strong>  Everybody seeks happiness! Not me, though! That&#39;s the difference between me and the rest of the world. Happiness isn&#39;t good enough for me! I demand euphoria!</p>
		<h3>On the complexities of existence</h3>
				<p><strong>Calvin:</strong>  They say the world is a stage. But obviously the play is unrehearsed and everybody is ad-libbing his lines.</p>
				<p><strong>Hobbes:</strong>  Maybe that’s why it’s hard to tell if we’re living in a tragedy or a farce.</p>
				<p><strong>Calvin:</strong>  We need more special effects and dance numbers.</p>
