		<h3>Why you shouldn't force vegetables on children</h3>
			<p>Barney's Dad was really bad so Barney hatched a plan<br/>When his dad said "Eat your peas."<br/>Barney shouted "No!" and ran</p>
			<p>Barney tricked his mean old dad and locked him in the cellar<br/>Barney's Mom never found out where he'd gone,<br/>Cause Barney didn't tell her.</p>
			<p>There his dad spent his life eating mice and gruel<br/>With every bite for fifty years<br/>He was sorry he'd been cruel</p>
	A day can really slip by when you're deliberately avoiding what you're supposed to do.
