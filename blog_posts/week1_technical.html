					<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can then begin hitting stretch goals, further increasing the project's awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered, which makes navigation an easy affair. Their header only contains the bare essential links, which aids in the site's simple appearance. Once you start exploring the different projects though, the site starts to show its strengths. The search pages return orderly rows and columns of rectangular snapshots of available projects with a few basic but very useful pieces of information. Dive further into one of those projects and you're presented with a plethora of facts, photos, and videos, along with the different levels of funding, all of which is kept in line by Kickstarter's straightforward interface. However, just because the site is well-planned doesn't always mean that individual project pages will be. Those layouts are still in the hands of the creators, some of which don't have the best eye for design.</p>
							<p>The site successfully helped to fund over 19,000 projects in 2013, along with $480 million in pledges. I have  backed seven projects to date, five of which have been successful. Kickstarter is an excellent way to turn great ideas into reality, although spending too much time on their site can be hazardous for one's bank account.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
							<p>Quite possibly the most useful site online in terms of available services, I use Amazon almost every day. Whenever I need to find a baseline price for an item I need, I go check Amazon first because of their vast catelog of things. The layout, while much less clean than Kickstarter, is highly functional. The main search bar is huge and just left of center, making it quick to locate (some sites like to hide their tiny search bars off to the side of the page, which is annoying). Using the menus on the left, you can refine your search to only include products of your desired specifications.</p>
							<p>In addition to the above, Amazon also features video streaming and allows you to build and maintain a collection of movies and TV shows on their cloud. Prime members get access to a portion of their video library for free, and when compared to Netflix the choices aren't quite as numbered, but new content is made free on a more regular basis. Much akin to Kickstarter, spending too much time on Amazon can lead to a dry bank account since you can purchase almost anything through their site.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a></h3>
							<p>I enjoy playing video games in my free time, so one look at Joystiq and it's easy to see why I spend about 20 minutes of my day there (if not more).Their layout is pretty standard as far as websites go, but their menu layout at the top of the page makes navigating through their various sections a breeze. Another website that I would describe as bright due to its use of whitespace, however not nearly as uncluttered as Kickstarter since most, if not all, pages display external ads. The primary reason that I frequent Joystiq is because they have a very skilled writing staff.</p>
							<p>One of the site's shortcomings is its search bar functionality, which is probably due in part to the fact that they are running on AOL's search engine as opposed to Google's. The returned results are more closely packed together, and they don't offer the same amount of information for the article as you get when using their site normally. Until recently Joystiq did not sell anything. Now, however, they have created a <a href="https://deals.joystiq.com/">Deals</a>page that catelogs numerous video game-related sales from all over the web.</p>
