			<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can then begin hitting stretch goals, further increasing the project's awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered, which makes navigation an easy affair. Their header only contains the bare essential links, which aids in the site's simple appearance. Once you start exploring the different projects though, the site starts to show its strengths. The search pages return orderly rows and columns of rectangular snapshots of available projects with a few basic but very useful pieces of information. Dive further into one of those projects and you're presented with a plethora of facts, photos, and videos, along with the different levels of funding, all of which is kept in line by Kickstarter's straightforward interface. However, just because the site is well-planned doesn't always mean that individual project pages will be. Those layouts are still in the hands of the creators, some of which don't have the best eye for design.</p>
							<p>The site successfully helped to fund over 19,000 projects in 2013, along with $480 million in pledges. I have  backed seven projects to date, five of which have been successful. Kickstarter is an excellent way to turn great ideas into reality, although spending too much time on their site can be hazardous for one's bank account.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
							<p>Quite possibly the most useful site online in terms of available services, I use Amazon almost every day. Whenever I need to find a baseline price for an item I need, I go check Amazon first because of their vast catelog of things. The layout, while much less clean than Kickstarter, is highly functional. The main search bar is huge and just left of center, making it quick to locate (some sites like to hide their tiny search bars off to the side of the page, which is annoying). Using the menus on the left, you can refine your search to only include products of your desired specifications.</p>
							<p>In addition to the above, Amazon also features video streaming and allows you to build and maintain a collection of movies and TV shows on their cloud. Prime members get access to a portion of their video library for free, and when compared to Netflix the choices aren't quite as numbered, but new content is made free on a more regular basis. Much akin to Kickstarter, spending too much time on Amazon can lead to a dry bank account since you can purchase almost anything through their site.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a></h3>
							<p>I enjoy playing video games in my free time, so one look at Joystiq and it's easy to see why I spend about 20 minutes of my day there (if not more).Their layout is pretty standard as far as websites go, but their menu layout at the top of the page makes navigating through their various sections a breeze. Another website that I would describe as bright due to its use of whitespace, however not nearly as uncluttered as Kickstarter since most, if not all, pages display external ads. The primary reason that I frequent Joystiq is because they have a very skilled writing staff.</p>
							<p>One of the site's shortcomings is its search bar functionality, which is probably due in part to the fact that they are running on AOL's search engine as opposed to Google's. The returned results are more closely packed together, and they don't offer the same amount of information for the article as you get when using their site normally. Until recently Joystiq did not sell anything. Now, however, they have a <a href="https://deals.joystiq.com/">Deals</a> page that catelogs numerous video game-related sales from all over the web, some of which include discounts on programming packages.</p>

			<h2 id="tweek2">Classes vs. IDs</h2>
						<h3>Basic Overview</h3>
							<p>Classes and IDs, while technically different, operate fundamentally the same. Basically, classes and IDs act as hooks within your HTML page so that your CSS and/or Javascript know which elements to affect and how. Both classes and IDs can be applied to just about every element on a page, however there are a few key rules to remember when using these features.</p>
						<h3>Classes are Not Unique</h3>
							<p>Classes are one of the more commonly used selectors in CSS. Classes can be applied to multiple elements on a page, and a single element can have more than one class assigned to it. This is quite helpful if you have a particular style that you want to replicate and use throughout your webpage. One example would be if you had two different styles of paragraph formatting--let's say they're called "science" and "culture"--that you wanted to use on your website. You can then create a single entry for each class within your CSS stylesheet and then apply them to the applicable article paragraphs throughout your website in order to differentiate between your scientific and cultural articles.</p>
						<h3>IDs are Unique</h3>
							<p>Unlike classes, there can only be a single instance of an ID in any given HTML page or document. Furthermore, an element can only have a single ID assigned to it. This is important to remember, because any site that includes the same ID on a page more than once will never pass code validation, and it could even negatively affect how the page is displayed. IDs are used when you only have one instance of a style or format on your page that you want to make unique.</p>
						<h3>Browser Interaction</h3>
							<p>Simply applying a class or ID name to an element does nothing to said element by default. This is because browsers do not have any set styling information related to classes or IDs stored. The CSS is what actually modifies your elements, based on the assigned class or ID.</p>
							<p>However, that's not to say that there is no interaction between a web browser and an ID. While classes may not have any special tricks up their proverbial sleeves, IDs can be referenced through a page link or URL. If you've ever seen a website URL with a '#' in it, such as http://yourdomain.com#comments, then that means the URL is actually searching for the corresponding ID on the page and then moving the browser's view port to it.</p>
						<h3>More Information</h3>
							<p>An element can have both a class and an ID applied to it. This is useful if you have a repeating style in your code that you want to apply to a unique element, such as a comments section that you want to be formatted in the same manner as the rest of your page text.</p>
							<p>CSS does not care whether you use a class or an ID, because there are no restrictions on the types of styling that you can apply to either. Javascript, on the other hand, cares greatly whether you use a class or an ID, because it relies on finding a single element on a page in order to function properly.</p>
						<br><br>
			<h2 id="tweek3">Javascript</h2>
							<p>What exactly does Javascript do? In a nutshell, it makes websites more interactive for the user. While in CSS you can do neat things like change the text color when mousing over links, Javascript takes dynamic web design to a new level. Because Javascript is a client-side language, it can run while a web page is open. From a user's point of view it makes change happen almost instantly because the scripts are not stored on some remote server, but within the user's local machine. Javascript is also a visually clean language to use. Everthing is an oject in Javascript, so integrating it with other languages can be a relatively simple matter.
							</p>
							<p>Javascript does have its downsides. Being a client-side language makes it much faster, but this also opens it up to potential security threats. When a user visits a website with JS implemented you are asking their machine to run through an unfamiliar piece of code. This means that an unsavory individual could use JS to steal personal information from someone's computer, or worse. This is why more cautious individuals will disable JS within their browsers. Client-side languages also rely on the user's machine to correctly run and interpret their code, so there is a potential for some machines to process JS differently than others. This can cause problems for your website if a visitor is using an outdated browser version.</p>

			<h2 id="tweek4">Enumerable#map</h2>
							<p>Arrays are the bread and butter of Ruby. As such, we need many different types of methods in order to add, subtract, or otherwise modify the elements of an array. But what about when we want to see what an array would look like modified without actually changing the original array? Enter the enumerable method <strong>map</strong>. The <strong>map</strong> method takes an array and transforms each element within in based on the code block to which it is assigned, and then returns a new, transformed copy of array, thereby preserving the original.</p>
								<p class="code">
								array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
								<br>
								brray = array.map{|x| -x}
								<br>
								<br>
								puts array.join(", ")   #=>   1, 2, 3, 4, 5
								<br>
								puts brray.join(", ")   #=>   -1, -2, -3, -4, -5
								</p>
							<p>So what exactly is happening up above? First, we're creating a new array. Then, we're creating a second new array named brray that is calling the <strong>map</strong> method in order to make a modified copy of array based on the assigned code block. As you can see from our final ouputs, array remains unchanged while brray is a transformed copy of array.
							</p>
							<p>What about when we do want to transform the elements within our array? Fret not, because there's <strong>map!</strong> for that. The <strong>map!</strong> method works exactly the same as <strong>map</strong> with one very important distinction:  <strong>map!</strong> is destructive. This means that calling <strong>map!</strong> on an array will permanently transform its elements as opposed to making a transformed copy.
							</p>
								<p class="code">
								array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
								<br>
								array.map!{|x| x * x}
								<br>
								<br>
								puts array.join(", ")   #=>   1, 4, 9, 16, 25	
								</p>
						<br><br>
			<h2 id="tweek5">Ruby Classes and Instances</h2>
						<h3>What are Classes?</h3>
							<p>Simply put, a Ruby class is an object that is defined by a user. They still adhere to the "everything is an object" philosophy, however classes take it one step further by being able to house instance methods and variables within themselves. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's take a look at the most basic example of a new class:</p>
								<p class="code">
								class Square
								<br><br>
								end
								</p>
							<p>It's important to remember that when creating a new class to always start it with a capital letter. Our <strong>Square</strong> class above is still incomplete in its current form. This is because a new class requires two things in order to validate its existence:  state and behavior. In terms of state, a class must have its instances defined by attributes. It regards to our <strong>Square</strong> class we can add side length, but for more complex classes, such as a new class of bicycle, we could add attributes for wheels, pedals, brakes, the chain, handlebars, etc, until we had all of the necessary parts for a working bicycle (depending on what we want our new bicycle class to accomplish). Going back to our new <strong>Square</strong>, let's give it a new attribute to represent side length:</p>
								<p class="code">
								class Square
								<br><br>
									def initialize(side_length)
									<br>
										@side_length = side_length
										<br>
									end
									<br><br>
								end
								</p>
							<p>Now we've created a new <strong>Square</strong> class and assigned it a single instance variable called <strong>@side_length</strong>, but it still doesn't actually do anything in terms of behavior. Continuing to keep matters simple, let's give our <strong>Square</strong> a purpose by defining a new method to calculate the perimeter of any given square as follows:</p>
								<p class="code">
								class Square
								<br><br>
									def initialize(side_length)
									<br>
									@side_length = side_length
									<br>
									end
									<br><br>
									def perimeter
									<br>
									@side_length * 4
									<br>
									end
									<br><br>
								end
								</p>
							<p>Now our <strong>Square</strong> has both a clearly defined state and behavior, meaning that we have succesfully created a new, valid class. Let's try it out!</p>
								<p class="code">
								p Square.new(10).perimeter
								<br>
								#=>   40 	
								</p>
						<h3>Variable Scope</h3>
							<p>You have no doubt noticed that when defining new variables for a new class the syntax is a bit different than it is normally. When defining new variables for a new class is it necessary to refer to them with the @ symbol. Looking back at our <strong>Square</strong> you can see that we have defined a single instance variable, <strong>@side_length</strong>. This means that whenever we need to use <strong>@side_length</strong> within our new class we must simply refer to it, just like we did in our <strong>perimeter</strong> method. Because <strong>@side_length</strong> is an instance variable we cannot refer to it anywhere outside of our <strong>Square</strong> class. Similarly, our <strong>perimeter</strong> method will only function when it's used in conjunction with our <strong>Square</strong> class, because it is an instance method. Trying to use either variable or method outside of our class would result in an error.</p>
