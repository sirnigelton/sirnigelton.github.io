					<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can start to hit stretch goals, further increasing their awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered.</p>
