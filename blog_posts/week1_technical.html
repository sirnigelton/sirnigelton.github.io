			<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can then begin hitting stretch goals, further increasing the project's awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered, which makes navigation an easy affair. Their header only contains the bare essential links, which aids in the site's simple appearance. Once you start exploring the different projects though, the site starts to show its strengths. The search pages return orderly rows and columns of rectangular snapshots of available projects with a few basic but very useful pieces of information. Dive further into one of those projects and you're presented with a plethora of facts, photos, and videos, along with the different levels of funding, all of which is kept in line by Kickstarter's straightforward interface. However, just because the site is well-planned doesn't always mean that individual project pages will be. Those layouts are still in the hands of the creators, some of which don't have the best eye for design.</p>
							<p>The site successfully helped to fund over 19,000 projects in 2013, along with $480 million in pledges. I have  backed seven projects to date, five of which have been successful. Kickstarter is an excellent way to turn great ideas into reality, although spending too much time on their site can be hazardous for one's bank account.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
							<p>Quite possibly the most useful site online in terms of available services, I use Amazon almost every day. Whenever I need to find a baseline price for an item I need, I go check Amazon first because of their vast catelog of things. The layout, while much less clean than Kickstarter, is highly functional. The main search bar is huge and just left of center, making it quick to locate (some sites like to hide their tiny search bars off to the side of the page, which is annoying). Using the menus on the left, you can refine your search to only include products of your desired specifications.</p>
							<p>In addition to the above, Amazon also features video streaming and allows you to build and maintain a collection of movies and TV shows on their cloud. Prime members get access to a portion of their video library for free, and when compared to Netflix the choices aren't quite as numbered, but new content is made free on a more regular basis. Much akin to Kickstarter, spending too much time on Amazon can lead to a dry bank account since you can purchase almost anything through their site.</p>
						<h3><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a></h3>
							<p>I enjoy playing video games in my free time, so one look at Joystiq and it's easy to see why I spend about 20 minutes of my day there (if not more).Their layout is pretty standard as far as websites go, but their menu layout at the top of the page makes navigating through their various sections a breeze. Another website that I would describe as bright due to its use of whitespace, however not nearly as uncluttered as Kickstarter since most, if not all, pages display external ads. The primary reason that I frequent Joystiq is because they have a very skilled writing staff.</p>
							<p>One of the site's shortcomings is its search bar functionality, which is probably due in part to the fact that they are running on AOL's search engine as opposed to Google's. The returned results are more closely packed together, and they don't offer the same amount of information for the article as you get when using their site normally. Until recently Joystiq did not sell anything. Now, however, they have a <a href="https://deals.joystiq.com/">Deals</a> page that catelogs numerous video game-related sales from all over the web, some of which include discounts on programming packages.</p>
			<h2>Classes vs. IDs</h2>
						<h3>Basic Overview</h3>
							<p>Classes and IDs, while technically different, operate fundamentally the same. Basically, classes and IDs act as hooks within your HTML page so that your CSS and/or Javascript know which elements to affect and how. Both classes and IDs can be applied to just about every element on a page, however there are a few key rules to remember when using these features.</p>
						<h3>Classes are Not Unique</h3>
							<p>Classes are one of the more commonly used selectors in CSS. Classes can be applied to multiple elements on a page, and a single element can have more than one class assigned to it. This is quite helpful if you have a particular style that you want to replicate and use throughout your webpage. One example would be if you had two different styles of paragraph formatting--let's say they're called "science" and "culture"--that you wanted to use on your website. You can then create a single entry for each class within your CSS stylesheet and then apply them to the applicable article paragraphs throughout your website in order to differentiate between your scientific and cultural articles.</p>
						<h3>IDs are Unique</h3>
							<p>Unlike classes, there can only be a single instance of an ID in any given HTML page or document. Furthermore, an element can only have a single ID assigned to it. This is important to remember, because any site that includes the same ID on a page more than once will never pass code validation, and it could even negatively affect how the page is displayed. IDs are used when you only have one instance of a style or format on your page that you want to make unique.</p>
						<h3>Browser Interaction</h3>
							<p>Simply applying a class or ID name to an element does nothing to said element by default. This is because browsers do not have any set styling information related to classes or IDs stored. The CSS is what actually modifies your elements, based on the assigned class or ID.</p>
							<p>However, that's not to say that there is no interaction between a web browser and an ID. While classes may not have any special tricks up their proverbial sleeves, IDs can be referenced through a page link or URL. If you've ever seen a website URL with a '#' in it, such as http://yourdomain.com#comments, then that means the URL is actually searching for the corresponding ID on the page and then moving the browser's view port to it.</p>
						<h3>More Information</h3>
							<p>An element can have both a class and an ID applied to it. This is useful if you have a repeating style in your code that you want to apply to a unique element, such as a comments section that you want to be formatted in the same manner as the rest of your page text.</p>
							<p>CSS does not care whether you use a class or an ID, because there are no restrictions on the types of styling that you can apply to either. Javascript, on the other hand, cares greatly whether you use a class or an ID, because it relies on finding a single element on a page in order to function properly.</p>
