					<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can then begin hitting stretch goals, further increasing the project's awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered, which makes navigation an easy affair. Their header only contains the bare essential links, which aids in the site's simple appearance. Once you start exploring the different projects though, the site starts to show its strengths. The search pages return orderly rows and columns of rectangular snapshots of available projects with a few basic but very useful pieces of information. Dive further into one of those projects and you're presented with a plethora of facts, photos, and videos, along with the different levels of funding, all of which is kept in line by Kickstarter's straightforward interface. However, just because the site is well-planned doesn't always mean that individual project pages will be. Those layouts are still in the hands of the creators, some of which don't have the best eye for design.</p>
							<p>The site successfully helped to fund over 19,000 projects in 2013, along with $480 million in pledges. I have  backed seven projects to date, five of which have been successful. Overall, Kickstarter is an excellent way to turn great ideas into reality, although spending too much time on their site can be hazardous for one's bank account.</p>
