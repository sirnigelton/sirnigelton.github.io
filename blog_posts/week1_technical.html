					<h2>Three of My Favorite Websites</h2>
						<h3><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></h3>
							<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites for a few reasons. First and formost, it's a place for people to get funding for their creative endeavors. I can always find something new and interesting whenever I visit the site, since new projects are being created every minute. The crowdfunding system itself also really makes you feel like an important part of the community, especially when the project you backed is successfully funded. Plus, super popular projects that exceed there initial goal can then begin hitting stretch goals, further increasing the project's awesomeness.</p>
							<p>I also enjoy the overall layout of their site, in that it is bright, clean, and uncluttered, which makes navigation an easy affair. Their header only contains the bare essential links, which aids in the site's simple appearance. Once you start exploring the different projects though, the site starts to show its strengths. The search pages return orderly rows and columns of rectangular snapshots of available projects with a few basic but very useful pieces of information. Dive further into one of those projects and you're presented with a plethora of facts, photos, and videos, along with the different levels of funding, all of which is kept in line by Kickstarter's straightforward design.</p>
