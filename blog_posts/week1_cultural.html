			<h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
					<p>After watching Shereef's fireside chat, I've got to say that I'm much less anxious about this whole experience. Even though my HTML/CSS skills are still beginner level, I'm feeling much more comfortable with everything the more I practice.</p>
					<p>The culture seems very engaging, in that people are encouraged to speak up, ask questions, and offer solutions. I am very excited to be participating in a learning environment that has such a positive hands-on approach. Making mistakes doesn't earn you a bad grade, it offers you a chance to learn something new.</p>
					<p>Although I am a little nervous about balancing the workload for Phase 0 with my job, I'm really looking forward to starting Phase 1, meeting everybody in person, and fully immersing myself in code.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="cweek2">My Thinking Style</h2>
					<p>My personal thinking style is primarily Abstract and Random, although the Concrete perceptual quality is still evident in my personality. This means that I tend to thrive in people-rich environments where I can collaborate freely with like-minded individuals. I count myself very fortunate to have found a company where the daily culture embodies this aspect so well. I prefer to work in a group for most projects, but a little alone time once in awhile is also very appreciated. I'm really looking forward to being able to collaborate with my peers in person, because I believe that while remote pairing sessions are very beneficial they would be much more effective if both people were sitting next to each other.</p>
					<p>So far the single biggest hurdle for me in Phase 0 has been balancing my work schedule with my homework schedule. Working full time (and then some) has made completing my assignments on time, or to a point where I feel totally satisfied with my work, has been challenging. I know that once I get into Phase 1 that things will flow more smoothly, so until then I'm trying to limit myself to the amount of homework I do in a given day. I found early on that saving all of my work for the weekend was a really good way to burn myself out, so I am in the process of devising a new weekly schedule that has me completing one to two exercises each evening while saving the larger solo challenges for the weekend.</p>

			<h2 id="cweek4">Issues in the Tech Industry:  Spam Email</h2>
					<p>A problem that anyone with an email account has experienced at one time or another, spam email continues to be one of the biggest issues within the tech industry. Conservative estimates say that more than half of all emails sent worldwide are considered to be spam, and numerous studies conducted in the past four years put that estimate closer to 80%, if not higher, depending on the country and time of year. The vast majority of spam messages are comprised of pharmaceutically-related advertisements, however phishing emails--messages designed to look like they are from a legitimate business in order to gather personal information--also make up a substantial portion of all spam. Messages that contain malicious attachments, such as viruses, invisible key logging scripts, or programs that allow unsavory individuals remote access to your computer, have been on a shallow decline over the past few years thanks to an increase in security software usage, such as McAfee, Avira, and Symantec.</p>
					<p>So, how can we protect ourselves from this onslaught of unwanted email? Spammers are constantly employing new tricks in order to get their messages viewed by more people, such as disguising a malicious link within a message that looks like a sign up confirmation or a non-delivery report. Fortunately, there are ways to combat the spammers. Earlier this year three of the biggest ESPs, <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/postmaster/yahoo-dmarc-policy-sln24050.html?impressions=true">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://postmaster-blog.aol.com/2014/04/22/aol-mail-updates-dmarc-policy-to-reject/">AOL</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2451690?hl=en">Gmail</a>, all implemented new DMARC policies for their respective domains in order to decrease the amount of spam that was being sent. These new policies make it so that anyone trying to send from a Yahoo, AOL, or Gmail address from outside of their respective servers with always have their messages rejected. You can read more about DMARC <a href="http://www.dmarc.org/overview.html">here</a>. Furthermore, the global email community is protected by a network of blacklists--a collection of websites and/or IP addresses associated with sending unsolicited or malicious email--and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamtrap">spam traps</a>. <a href="http://www.spamcop.net/bl.shtml">SpamCop</a>, <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/">Spamhaus</a>, and <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/">Project Honey Pot</a> are a few of the leading players in the email anti-abuse community.</p>
					<p>ESPs track when a message is marked as spam, so most of the time you won't have to deal with spam messages in your inbox. However, these filters are not foolproof so once in awhile one of these messages will get delivered to your inbox. If you happen receive a malicious message in your inbox, the absolute safest things that you can do are to either mark it as spam or just delete it.</p>

			<h2 id="cweek5">Pair Programming in Review</h2>
					<p>Before starting Dev Bootcamp, I was vaguely familiar with the concept of pair programming, however the particulars, as well as the benefits, were not immediately clear. My first thought was that I would never have the time to pair program, or that I'd have a particularly difficult time finding a way to juggle pair programming sessions around a full-time work schedule. Secondly, how beneficial can a pair programming session really be if both people are still beginners, or if one person is more advanced than the other?</p>
					<p>First and foremost, finding time for pairing sessions has not been nearly as painful as I expected. It helps that we all have mandatory pairing requirements for each unit, but I don't find myself struggling to make the minimums because plenty of other people want to pair. Even though I work for eight hours every weekday, I can usually find someone willing in pair in the evenings or on the weekends. Having an awesome, communicative accountability group helps even more.</p>
					<p>Pairing with another beginner level coder can be very beneficial in helping to further establish the basic foundations and principles of a language, especially when you have to talk your way through things out loud. Since the majority of people do not talk to themselves when working alone, myself included, I found that I was overlooking far few issues when I was working with another person. It's also extremely nice to have another person available to test ideas or ask questions, since they may have thought of a better way to solve a particular problem with which you were struggling. Pairing with a person beyond your skill level, while potentially daunting at first, can be very advantageous. Being able to ask someone more specific use-case or difficult questions that another beginner, or Google, wouldn't be able to answer can be a great way to advance your knowledge.</p>
					<p>The other wonderful benefit to pair programming is receiving feedback. Not only does this tell you how you are coming along as a developer, it also lets you know how you are performing as a person. The feedback that I have received in regards to my coding skills has been invaluable, as it has allowed me to focus my efforts on the areas that I have had a harder time comprehending. The feedback concerning how I work as an individual has also been greatly useful in helping me figure out how to be a better driver, navigator, and an all-around more communicative person. When writing feedback for others I was, at first, very delicate. Even though we are leaving anonymous feedback I was still afraid that I would offend someone. After the first couple of weeks it became apparent that the best feedback includes helpful, actionable criticisms (because pobody is nerfect) along with kind words of encouragement. Once we all realized this I felt that the feedback I saw became much more useful.</p>
					<p>Overall, pair programming has been an immensely helpful learning tool in these early stages of our web development careers, and it promises to continue being helpful no matter what our skill levels. Once my initial worries surrounding pairing were dealt with I was able to truly appreciate the awesomeness of pair programming.</p>

			<h2 id="cweek6">Stereotype Threat</h2>
					<p><em>"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group."</em></p>
					<p>While the above quote is a rather succinct way of putting it, stereotype threat is a term that pertains to a person's feelings about themselves in relation to the negative societal perceptions surrounding a particular collection or group of people. For example, studies were conducted in the 90s that showed black students performing more poorly on tests than white students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized the black students performed just as well as the white students.</p>
					<p>I have experienced stereotype threat myself in a relatively minor capacity in the past, most notably in college after I joined a fraternity. When I joined my fraternity I did so for a few reasons: I wanted to make new friends (I didn't know anyone else at school entering my freshman year), I wanted to get involved in the community by means of volunteering and philanthropy, and I wanted to continue playing sports but in a less competitive fashion (intramurals). Overall though, I wanted to be a part of a group of like-minded individuals that I could count on in times of need and vice versa. I ended up joining one of the smaller fraternities on campus who were, at the time, not known for much in particular within the Greek community, save for getting decent grades. Outside of the Greek community, however, I was still viewed with the same expectations that many people who have not experienced Greek life believe after watching movies and TV shows, in that I was just there to party and chew bubblegum--and I was all out of bubblegum. This lead to a few instances of me giving into these external perceptions, which, when looking back on it, I may have done almost out of pure spite. I believe that these experiences in my first year of college also had a hand in pushing me to study anthropology, especially the cultural subfield.</p>
					<p>So, how do I deal with the concept of stereotype threat today? For starters, I try to never <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/when_you_assume.png">assume</a> anything about a person that I don't know. The majority of persumptions a person makes when meeting someone new happen within the first few minutes of their first meeting, and many people, myself included, are inclined to jump to unfounded conclusions about a person depending on those introductory conversations. This is why we are generally so focused on making a great first impression, lest we be incorrectly labeled as something we are not. Another wonderfully helpful concept in not submitting to stereotype threat is that of empathy. Putting yourself in another person's shoes can be incredibly humbling, as well as eye-opening. Everyone is dealing with different situations in their lives, so what applies to you may not have any bearing on another person's existence and vice versa.</p>

			<h2 id="cweek7">Personal Values</h2>
					<p>Everyone has values by which they define themselves. These values provide us with focus and purpose. When I think about my past and where I'm headed for the future, four distinct values come to mind:  adventure, determination, independence, and personal development. I have always tried to live my life to fullest, whether that be a grandly planned vacation or a simple weekend excursion. My determination keeps me focused on tasks at hand, and it doesn't let me give up at the first sign of a problem. Being truly independent is a wonderful feeling, because it means that I make all of my own decisions and I don't need to live my life based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWgVdY3SfbI">someone else's standards</a>.</p>
					<p>The value that's the most important to me currently is my personal development. I'm at a point in life where I still want to further my eductation and I have the means to do it. I've always strived to better myself in any way I can, and taking part in DBC is my most recent self-improving adventure. This applies to outside of work as well; I have been working hard to improve my disc golf techniques this summer.</p>
					<p>Rating each on a 1 to 5 scale of how well I live up to these values is as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Adventure - 4</li>
						<li>Determination - 3</li>
						<li>Independence - 5</li>
						<li>Personal Development - 4</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Since I started taking part in DBC, I have been getting all sorts of questions from friends and coworkers about why I'm pursuing this program specifically and what recommendations I can make for those thinking about walking the same, or a similar, path. A recent question I got from a coworker was "how can I start getting involved with coding and how did you decide that you wanted to make this a more permanent career switch?" After suggesting both <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/trails">Thoughbot</a> for beginner lessons, I didn't have to think too long on the second part of the question. One common theme throughout my life is that I've never been fully satisfied with whatever it is I'm doing at work, especially if I've been doing the same thing for a long time. This means that I have a tendency to crave new things to do or new problems to work out, which just so happens to lend itself quite well to development work, where a single problem can be solved in a multitude of ways.</p>
					<p>The way I see it, being able to identify stereotype threat builds into my personal development value. Now that I'm more conscious of the concept, I can (hopefully) more quickly identify when someone is feeling threatened in order to help remove them from that uncomfortable situation. Whenever I'm feeling down at home some happy music and the outdoors are usually enough to pick me back up, and I will definitely be utilizing these practices when Phase 1 kicks off.</p>
