			<h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
					<p>After watching Shereef's fireside chat, I've got to say that I'm much less anxious about this whole experience. Even though my HTML/CSS skills are still beginner level, I'm feeling much more comfortable with everything the more I practice.</p>
					<p>The culture seems very engaging, in that people are encouraged to speak up, ask questions, and offer solutions. I am very excited to be participating in a learning environment that has such a positive hands-on approach. Making mistakes doesn't earn you a bad grade, it offers you a chance to learn something new.</p>
					<p>Although I am a little nervous about balancing the workload for Phase 0 with my job, I'm really looking forward to starting Phase 1, meeting everybody in person, and fully immersing myself in code.</p>
