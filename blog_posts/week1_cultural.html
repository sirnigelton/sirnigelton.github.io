			<h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
					<p>After watching Shereef's fireside chat, I've got to say that I'm much less anxious about this whole experience. Even though my HTML/CSS skills are still beginner level, I'm feeling much more comfortable with everything the more I practice.</p>
					<p>The culture seems very engaging, in that people are encouraged to speak up, ask questions, and offer solutions. I am very excited to be participating in a learning environment that has such a positive hands-on approach. Making mistakes doesn't earn you a bad grade, it offers you a chance to learn something new.</p>
					<p>Although I am a little nervous about balancing the workload for Phase 0 with my job, I'm really looking forward to starting Phase 1, meeting everybody in person, and fully immersing myself in code.</p>
			<h2 id="cweek2">My Thinking Style</h2>
					<p>My personal thinking style is primarily Abstract and Random, although the Concrete perceptual quality is still evident in my personality. This means that I tend to thrive in people-rich environments where I can collaborate freely with like-minded individuals. I count myself very fortunate to have found a company where the daily culture embodies this aspect so well. I prefer to work in a group for most projects, but a little alone time once in awhile is also very appreciated. I'm really looking forward to being able to collaborate with my peers in person, because I believe that while remote pairing sessions are very beneficial they would be much more effective if both people were sitting next to each other.</p>
					<p>So far the single biggest hurdle for me in Phase 0 has been balancing my work schedule with my homework schedule. Working full time (and then some) has made completing my assignments on time, or to a point where I feel totally satisfied with my work, has been challenging. I know that once I get into Phase 1 that things will flow more smoothly, so until then I'm trying to limit myself to the amount of homework I do in a given day. I found early on that saving all of my work for the weekend was a really good way to burn myself out, so I am in the process of devising a new weekly schedule that has me completing one to two exercises each evening while saving the larger solo challenges for the weekend.</p>
			<h2 id="cweek4">Issues Faced in the Tech Industry:  Spam Email</h2>
					<p>A problem that anyone with an email account has experienced at one time or another, spam email continues to be one of the biggest issues within the tech industry. Conservative estimates say that more than half of all emails sent worldwide are considered to be spam, and numerous studies conducted in the past four years put that estimate closer to 80%, if not higher, depending on the country and time of year. The vast majority of spam messages are comprised of pharmaceutically-related advertisements, however phishing emails--messages designed to look like they are from a legitimate business in order to gather personal information--also make up a substantial portion of all spam. Messages that contain malicious attachments, such as viruses, invisible key logging scripts, or programs that allow unsavory individuals remote access to your computer, have been on a shallow decline over the past few years thanks to an increase in security software usage, such as McAfee, Avira, and Symantec.</p>
					<p>So, how can we protect ourselves from this onslaught of unwanted email? Spammers are constantly employing new tricks in order to get their messages viewed by more people, such as disguising a malicious link within a message that looks like a sign up confirmation or a non-delivery report. Fortunately, there are ways to combat the spammers. Earlier this year three of the biggest ESPs, <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/postmaster/yahoo-dmarc-policy-sln24050.html?impressions=true">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://postmaster-blog.aol.com/2014/04/22/aol-mail-updates-dmarc-policy-to-reject/">AOL</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2451690?hl=en">Gmail</a>, all implemented new DMARC policies for their respective domains in order to decrease the amount of spam that was being sent. These new policies make it so that anyone trying to send from a Yahoo, AOL, or Gmail address from outside of their respective servers with always have their messages rejected. You can read more about what DMARC is <a href="http://www.dmarc.org/overview.html">here</a>. Furthermore, the global email community is protected by a network of blacklists--a collection of websites and/or IP addresses associated with sending unsolicited or malicious email--and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamtrap">spam traps</a>. <a href="http://www.spamcop.net/bl.shtml">SpamCop</a>, <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/">Spamhaus</a>, and <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/">Project Honey Pot</a> are a few of the leading players in the email anti-abuse community.</p>
					<p>ESPs track when a message is marked as spam, so most of the time you won't have to deal with spam messages in your inbox. However, these filters are not foolproof so once in awhile one of these messages will get delivered to your inbox. If you happen receive a malicious message in your inbox, the absolute safest things that you can do are to either mark it as spam or just delete it.</p>
