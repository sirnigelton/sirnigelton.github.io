			<h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
					<p>After watching Shereef's fireside chat, I've got to say that I'm much less anxious about this whole experience. Even though my HTML/CSS skills are still beginner level, I'm feeling much more comfortable with everything the more I practice.</p>
					<p>The culture seems very engaging, in that people are encouraged to speak up, ask questions, and offer solutions. I am very excited to be participating in a learning environment that has such a positive hands-on approach. Making mistakes doesn't earn you a bad grade, it offers you a chance to learn something new.</p>
					<p>Although I am a little nervous about balancing the workload for Phase 0 with my job, I'm really looking forward to starting Phase 1, meeting everybody in person, and fully immersing myself in code.</p>
			<h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
					<p>My personal thinking style is primarily Abstract and Random, although the Concrete perceptual quality is still evident in my personality. This means that I tend to thrive in people-rich environments where I can collaborate freely with like-minded individuals. I count myself very fortunate to have found a company where the daily culture embodies this aspect so well. I prefer to work in a group for most projects, but a little alone time once in awhile is also very appreciated. I'm really looking forward to being able to collaborate with my peers in person, because I believe that while remote pairing sessions are very beneficial they would be much more effective if both people were sitting next to each other.	
					</p>
					<p>So far the single biggest hurdle for me in Phase 0 has been balancing my work schedule with my homework schedule. Working full time (and then some) has made completing my assignments on time, or to a point where I feel totally satisfied with my work, has been challenging. I know that once I get into Phase 1 that things will flow more smoothly, so until then I'm trying to limit myself to the amount of homework I do in a given day. I found early on that saving all of my work for the weekend was a really good way to burn myself out, so I am in the process of devising a new weekly schedule that has me completing one to two exercises each evening while saving the larger solo challenges for the weekend.
